## About LEAFCHECK

**LEAFCHECk**  is an Android-based product Capstone, currently being developed by a team of 7 developers from Team Capstone C241-PS391 in the **Bangkit Academy 2024 Program**. the team consists of 3 machine learning specialists, 2 cloud computing engineers, and 2 mobile development experts.
## Background

The problem of harvest losses due to pests and diseases has been extensively documented in many literature. According to Oerke (2006), plant diseases alone can cause pretty significant yield losses, estimating between 20%-40% globally. Using traditional methods which were done by domain experts to visually diagnose the leaves to get the disease can be time-consuming (Dutot et. al., 2013). Therefore, there is a pressing need for an accessible and efficient solution to diagnose crop diseases accurately and prom


## Goal & Aim

LeafCheck is a mobile application aimed at revolutionizing crop disease diagnosis by leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze leaf images for disease detection. With a backend powered by Google Cloud Run, LeafCheck offers users a seamless and efficient platform for identifying plant diseases and providing appropriate solutions.
